# Roman Numerals To Integers

This Python script converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
```

3. Add a section for the script's usage. You can include a brief explanation and some examples. Here's an example:

```markdown
## Usage

To use this script, simply call the `romanToInt` function with a Roman numeral as an argument. The function will return the corresponding integer.
```

        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000

````

```python
print(romanToInt("III"))      # Output: 3
print(romanToInt("LVIII"))    # Output: 58
print(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"))  # Output: 1994
````

4. Add a section for the script's dependencies. Since this script only uses Python's built-in libraries, you can mention that no additional dependencies are required. Here's an example:

```markdown
## Dependencies

This script does not require any additional Python libraries.
```

5. Save the `README.md` file in the same directory as your Python script.
