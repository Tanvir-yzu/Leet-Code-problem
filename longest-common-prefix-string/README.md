Sure, here's a basic README.md file for your "longest common prefix string" Python script:

```markdown
# Longest Common Prefix String

This Python script finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the command `python main.py`.
4. The script will output the longest common prefix string for the provided test cases.

## Example

```python
strs1 = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strs1))  # Output: "fl"

strs2 = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strs2))  # Output: ""
```

## Function Explanation

- `longest_common_prefix(strs)`: This function takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix string.
- `is_common_prefix(strs, length)`: This function checks if a given length is a common prefix for all strings in the list.

## Test Cases

The script includes two test cases:
- `strs1 = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]`: The longest common prefix is "fl".
- `strs2 = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]`: There is no common prefix, so the output is an empty string.

## Dependencies

- This script uses the `icecream` module for debugging. You can install it using `pip install icecream`.
